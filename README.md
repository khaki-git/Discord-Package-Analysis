# Guide

Requesting Data:

* On Discord, go to Settings>Privacy & Safety and then scroll all the way to the bottom.
* There you will find a button saying ***request my data***. Press it.
* You will shortly (from a few hours to a month) receive an Email from Discord
* It will contain your Data Package, click on the link to download it.
***
Analyzing Data:

* Extract the zip file on your Desktop (or anywhere else you like, it doesn't really matter)
* Open the Discord Package Analysis program
* Press the button that says ***Select a Folder*** and then open your folder in Explorer.
* The program will freeze for a few seconds, this is because it is analyzing all the data (which can take a long time.)
* You will be greeted by a new window with results once it's done.
* A *.txt* copy of your results will be saved in the ./results/ directory, called *package.txt*
